If you're a web developer looking for a way to get started with Typescript, you're in luck. TypeScript NodeJs Starter Pack on GitHub is the perfect solution to get your feet wet. This starter pack contains all the essential packages you need to get started with TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js. In this guide, we'll show you how to use this starter pack to build your TypeScript application. So, let's get started!

# 1.Introduction to TypeScript NodeJs  Starter Pack

The goal of the TypeScript NodeJs NodeJs  Starter Pack is to provide developers with a streamlined way to get started with TypeScript, without having to spend time setting up their development environment.

# 2.Auto Build-Execute for TypeScript and Node.js

One of the essential packages included in TypeScript Nodejs Starter Pack is ts-node. Ts-node is a TypeScript execution environment for Node.js that allows developers to execute TypeScript code directly without having to compile it first. Ts-node is perfect for developers who want to focus on writing code without worrying about the build process.

To install ts-node, you'll need to run the following command:

npm install -g ts-node

# 3.Powerful and Easy to Handle HTTP Requests with Express.js

Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is perfect for building web applications and APIs. Express.js is included in the TypeScript Starter Pack, and it's a great choice for developers who want to handle HTTP requests and build web applications.

To install Express.js, you'll need to run the following command:

npm install express

# 4.Type Checking for Node.js

Type definitions for Node.js is important. Type checking is an essential part of building robust applications, and the TypeScript NodeJs  Starter Pack makes it easy for developers to get started with type checking.

To install type definitions for Node.js, you'll need to run the following command:

npm install -D @types/node

# 5.Type Checking for Express.js

In addition to type definitions for Node.js, TypeScript NodeJs  Starter Pack also includes type definitions for Express.js. Type checking for Express.js is essential, as it helps developers catch errors and bugs before they become problems.

To install type definitions for Express.js, you'll need to run the following command:

npm install -D @types/express

# 6.Different Import Keywords

One of the main differences between Node.js and TypeScript is the way they handle imports. In Node.js, the import keyword is require(). In TypeScript, the import keyword is used to import modules.

# 7.Listener

When developing an extensive application, it's essential to have a watch parameter to help you restart your server whenever you make and save changes to your code. Ts-node-dev is a package that watches .ts files, and whenever you make a change, it will restart the server for you.

To install ts-node-dev, you'll need to run the following command:

npm install -D ts-node-dev

# 8.TypeScript Getting Started

Now that you have a basic understanding of TypeScript NodeJs Starter Pack, it's time to get started. First, you'll need to clone the repository from GitHub. Once you've cloned the repository, you can navigate to the project's directory and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

npm install

Once the installation is complete, you can start the server by running the following command:

npm run start

# 9.Conclusion

TypeScript NodeJs Starter Pack is an excellent starting point for developers who want to get started with TypeScript.
